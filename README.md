# Java Student Repository 

This Java project demonstrates various features including object-oriented programming, inheritance, interfaces, exception handling, and data structures in Java.

## Project Structure

- **model**: Contains classes representing various entities such as courses, grades, people, etc.
- **repository**: Includes implementations of repositories for managing data related to subscriptions, grades, people, and courses.
- **semester**: Provides an enumeration for representing semesters.
- **semester**: Provides an enumeration for representing semesters.
- **utils**: Contains utility classes, such as FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure.
- **Main.java**: Main entry point of the application.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes and interfaces are used to represent different entities and functionalities.
- **Inheritance**: Subclasses are derived from parent classes to represent specialized entities.
- **Interfaces**: Used to define contracts for implementing certain functionalities.
- **Exception Handling**: Demonstrated with the `FIFOException` class and handling in the main method.
- **Data Structures**: Use of FIFO data structure in the `FIFO` class.
- **Repositories**: Implementations for managing data and performing operations like add, delete, print, etc.
- **Enumeration**: Use of enum types to represent semesters.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
